# Data Utilization Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document defines the strategic framework for leveraging data assets within the Operation Sentinel ecosystem.

### ⚡ At a Glance (For Assessors)
*   **What we use:** Data from simulations (AirSim) and real sensors (LiDAR/Camera).
*   **Why we use it:** To train the AI to recognize obstacles and landing zones without human help.
*   **The Goal:** A drone that gets smarter with every flight, eventually flying completely on its own in unknown environments.
