## Project Description
Operation Sentinel is an offline capable autonomous drone simulation stack designed for operation in GPS degraded environments.
It runs PX4 SITL with Gazebo Harmonic and exposes telemetry and command and control through a local backend API.

## Motivation
GPS availability is not guaranteed in real world deployments.
The objective of this project is to demonstrate autonomous navigation and safe control behavior using local sensing inputs and local compute.

## Implementation summary
1. Simulation
	PX4 SITL with Gazebo Harmonic is used as the flight control and physics environment.

2. Demonstration generation
	A planning based demonstration generator is used to produce reference trajectories for training and evaluation.

3. Control policy training
	A data driven control policy is trained from demonstrations and validated in simulation.

4. System integration
	A local Docker Compose stack provides a backend API, Redis for command and telemetry exchange, and a TimescaleDB datastore.
	A bridge script connects to PX4 via MAVSDK and publishes telemetry while consuming commands.

## Engineering challenges
1. Simulation environment migration
	Migrating from a legacy simulator to PX4 and Gazebo required changes in tooling, interfaces, and runtime setup.

2. Host and runtime boundaries
	Running simulation in WSL2 while hosting services in Docker requires careful networking and configuration.

3. Operational stability
	Control loops must be robust to transient failures and provide clear logs for verification.
